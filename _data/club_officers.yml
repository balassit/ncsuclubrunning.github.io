  biography: "I am a senior, majoring in Computer Science, from High Point, NC. I am an Eagle Scout. I love running, and keeping up with pro and collegiate running, possibly a little too much. I am a self proclaimed miler, who broke 5:00 in my freshman year of college. My favorite run is probably when we run in downtown Raleigh on a Friday, because of our adoring car fans."

  biography: "Hi! I’m a sophomore, from Pinehurst, North Carolina. I’m majoring in Human Biology with hopes of one day going to medical school and becoming a doctor. My favorite part about club running here at NC State is all of the great people you get to meet! When I’m not running, I also enjoy playing on the Club Soccer team, helping run the Student Government, coaching the next generation of runners, and cheering on the Wolfpack!"

  biography: "I am a sophomore, double majoring in chemical and textile engineering, from Greensboro, NC. In addition to running, I enjoy traveling (I’ve been to 17 states and 9 countries), shopping, baking, listening to Taylor Swift, and eating bagels (According to my friends I eat an excessive amount of bagels). When I am not at practice, you can probably find me struggling to bike up hills on campus, studying, watching Netflix, or eating Campfire Delight ice cream from Howling Cow!"

  biography: "G'day! I'm a junior majoring in computer science from West Jefferson, NC. My Dad is from New Zealand, so I frequently imitate his accent. When I'm not running, I really enjoy computer science and math, especially machine learning and backend web development. I also listen to tons of music (I have more than 60 playlists on Spotify), travel some (18 states and 5 countries), and have a twin. I lived on a boat for 2.5 years as a kid. I like to think I'm somewhat friendly, so come talk to me anytime!"
